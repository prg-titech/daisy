# Daisy: A Block-Based Environment to Learn Data Modeling<br>

_(development in progress)_

In programming problem solving, data modeling is a process to define data structure in programming language that represent information in the problem description.

Daisy is the web-based block programming environment for beginners to learn data modeling. There are two steps of executing data modeling:
1. Information Mining: collecting keywords from problem description which can represents I/O needed.
2. Data Representation: represent keywords from the former steps to create data structure. In this case, we drive student to learn the creation of Algebraic Data Type (ADT) as a data representation.
